Number Guessing Game

Description

The Number Guessing Game is a console-based application where the computer generates a random number between 1 and 100. The user is prompted to guess the number, receiving feedback on whether their guess is too high, too low, or correct. The game includes features such as limiting the number of attempts, playing multiple rounds, and tracking the user's score based on the number of attempts taken.

Features

* Generate a random number between 1 and 100.
* User guesses the number with feedback provided.
* Limited attempts to guess correctly.
* Option to play multiple rounds.
* Score tracking based on attempts.

How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `NumberGuessingGame` directory.
3. Compile and run the `NumberGuessingGame.java` file.

```bash
javac NumberGuessingGame.java
java NumberGuessingGame
```

Additional Notes

* Ensure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.

Student Grade Calculator

Description

This application takes marks obtained in various subjects and calculates the total marks, average percentage, and assigns a grade based on the average percentage. The grades are determined according to predefined thresholds.

Features

* Input marks for each subject.
* Calculate total marks and average percentage.
* Assign grades based on average percentage.
* Display the results.

How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `StudentGradeCalculator` directory.
3. Compile and run the `StudentGradeCalculator.java` file.

```bash
javac StudentGradeCalculator.java
java StudentGradeCalculator
```

Additional Notes

* The application assumes marks are out of 100 for each subject.

ATM Interface

Description

The ATM Interface simulates basic ATM operations such as withdrawing money, depositing money, and checking the balance. It includes validation to ensure the user's transactions are within acceptable limits and displays appropriate messages based on the success or failure of transactions.

Features

* Withdraw, deposit, and check balance options.
* User input validation.
* Interaction between ATM class and user's bank account class.

How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `ATMInterface` directory.
3. Compile and run the `ATMInterface.java` file.

```bash
javac ATMInterface.java
java ATMInterface
```

Additional Notes

* The user interface is console-based for simplicity.
* Ensure to follow the prompts for a seamless experience.

Currency Converter

Description

The Currency Converter application allows users to select a base currency and a target currency, fetches real-time exchange rates from a reliable API, and converts a specified amount from the base currency to the target currency. The converted amount and target currency symbol are displayed to the user.

Features

* Choose base and target currencies.
* Fetch real-time exchange rates.
* Convert specified amount and display results.

How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `CurrencyConverter` directory.
3. Compile and run the `CurrencyConverter.java` file.

```bash
javac CurrencyConverter.java
java CurrencyConverter
```

Additional Notes

* Ensure you have an internet connection to fetch real-time exchange rates.
* You may need to obtain an API key from a currency exchange rate service.

Student Management System

Description

The Student Management System is designed to manage a collection of students, allowing for operations such as adding, removing, searching, and displaying student details. The system also includes data storage capabilities and validation to ensure proper input.

Features

* Add, remove, search, and display students.
* Console-based user interface.
* Read and write student data to a file.
* Input validation for required fields.

How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the `StudentManagementSystem` directory.
3. Compile and run the `StudentManagementSystem.java` file.

```bash
javac StudentManagementSystem.java
java StudentManagementSystem
```

Additional Notes

* The current implementation uses file-based storage for simplicity.
* Follow the on-screen
